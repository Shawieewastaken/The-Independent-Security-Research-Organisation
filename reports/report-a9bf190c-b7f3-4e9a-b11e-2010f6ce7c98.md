# Discord Scam Report: QR Code Phishing via Bot Impersonation

## Overview

This report details a phishing scam on Discord where a malicious bot impersonates a legitimate bot, prompting users to scan a QR code. Scanning the QR code results in the user's account being compromised.

## Scam Description

### Method

1. **Bot Impersonation**: The scam begins with a malicious bot impersonating a well-known, legitimate bot. The fake bot uses similar usernames, profile pictures, and behaviors to appear authentic.
  
2. **QR Code Prompt**: The malicious bot sends a message to users, typically in a channel or direct message, asking them to scan a QR code to verify their identity or complete some action. The message might include convincing language and design to further the illusion of legitimacy.

3. **Account Compromise**: When the user scans the QR code using the Discord mobile app, they inadvertently log into the attacker's session. This action hands over control of their account to the attacker.

### Example Message

## Indicators of the Scam

1. **Urgency and Verification Requests**: The message often uses urgent language and the need for verification to prompt immediate action.
  
2. **QR Code**: The use of a QR code for logging in is unusual for most legitimate bots and services.

3. **Mobile App Requirement**: Insistence on using the Discord mobile app to scan the QR code.

4. **Impersonation**: The bot closely mimics a legitimate bot, but may have slight discrepancies in username or tag numbers.

## Preventive Measures

1. **Verification**: Always verify the authenticity of the bot by checking its username, tag number, and server role.

2. **Avoid Scanning QR Codes**: Do not scan QR codes from untrusted sources or unsolicited messages.

3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable 2FA on your Discord account to add an additional layer of security.

4. **Report and Block**: Report the scam bot to Discord and block it to prevent further interactions.

5. **Educate Users**: Spread awareness about this scam to prevent others from falling victim.

## Actions to Take if Compromised

1. **Change Passwords**: Immediately change your Discord password and the passwords of any accounts that might share the same credentials.

2. **Revoke Authorized Apps**: Check and revoke any unauthorized applications that have access to your Discord account.

3. **Enable 2FA**: If not already enabled, set up two-factor authentication on your account.

4. **Contact Discord Support**: Reach out to Discord Support to report the incident and seek further assistance.
